# Customer-Churn-Prediction :

Builds machine learning models to predict customer attrition using behavior and transaction data. Includes Python analysis, SQL queries, and Tableau dashboards to identify high-risk customers and guide retention strategies.
Project Overview

This project builds machine learning models to predict customer attrition using past customer behavior and transaction data. The goal is to identify high-risk customers and recommend strategies to reduce churn.

# Tools & Technologies :

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL for querying customer behavior data

Tableau for interactive churn dashboards Open the Tableau workbook or 
# access it via Tableau Public link : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sg1710/vizzes

# Project Structure :

datasets/ → Raw and processed datasets (Telco_Customer_Churn.csv, churn_predictions.csv)

notebooks/ → Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model building

dashboards/ → Tableau dashboards for churn visualization and business insights

# Key Steps :

Data Preprocessing – handle categorical features, missing values, and churn encoding

Exploratory Analysis – churn by contract type, tenure, and payment method

Modeling – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, threshold tuning

Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Export Predictions – churn probability dataset for Tableau dashboards

# Outcomes :

Logistic Regression achieved ~81% accuracy with good balance of precision & recall

Identified contract type, tenure, and payment method as key churn drivers

Built churn probability distribution to highlight high-risk customers

Created Tableau dashboards for churn trends and actionable retention insights

# Business Recommendations :

Offer loyalty discounts to short-tenure customers

Promote annual contracts to reduce churn risk

Provide incentives for secure payment methods

Implement proactive follow-ups for high-risk customers

✅ With this project, business teams can anticipate churn and design data-driven retention strategies.
